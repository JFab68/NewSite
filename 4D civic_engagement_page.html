                        <h3>Moral Authority & Lived Experience</h3>
                        <p>Our newest initiative prepares formerly incarcerated individuals for civic engagement and community leadership through comprehensive training in advocacy, policy development, and public speaking. This program empowers returning citizens to participate meaningfully in the democratic process and shape the systems that impact their lives.</p>
                        
                        <p>Through structured curricula and mentorship opportunities, participants develop their knowledge of government structures, legislative processes, and effective advocacy strategies. The program includes hands-on experience in policy analysis, media engagement, community organizing, and public testimony.</p>

                        <h3>Unique Insights Drive Reform</h3>
                        <p>This initiative recognizes the unique insights and moral authority that formerly incarcerated individuals bring to discussions about criminal legal system reform. By cultivating a network of skilled advocates with lived experience, we help ensure that policy discussions include the perspectives of those most directly impacted by the system.</p>
